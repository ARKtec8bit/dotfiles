British English thesaurus for openoffice.org v3.

Based on PaulH's brit-thesaurus.sourceforge.net, just repackaged
for v3, his readme is below.

This has been created using the wordnet thesaurus supplied with
openoffice and is therefore sill covered by the wordnet license, a
copy of which should be enclosed. I would appreciate it my work
was acknowledged by a reference to brit-thesaurus.sourceforge.net.
when distributing this or derived work.

This is a fairly conservative modification. I am not a linguist,
and have changed only the obvious words from the American to
British spelling. I have been guided heavily by the openoffice
spell checker, which allows some words with both -ise and -ize,
so I have left them both in. Also the thesaurus contains many
words that are not in the spell checker, so I have left them
as is (e.g. where a word ending -ize was still not recognised
when it ended -ise) 

Since the original contained both British and American spellings,
the entries for (say) color and colour have been merged. This may
not have been done very well, though on most occasions they were
very similar or the same.

When the Meaning was the same as the original word, it was removed
and the next word was used in the hope that it would give more of
an idea as to what the rest of the synonyms would be.

If you use this, I would appreciate comments in the foums at
sourceforge, good or bad, so I can improve the work.
